            <h1>Are you tired of the frustration you feel when you fail to recall something you learned?</h1>
            <p>
                German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus probably felt the same, and so he decided to study how memory works, ultimately producing the forgetting curve which shows how newly learned information is lost over time unless consciously reviewed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fascinated by his discovery, scientists tried to come up with effective memorising techniques, two of which stood above others proving their high effectiveness and success : active recall and spaced repitition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Active recall involves retrieving information from memory through, essentially, testing yourself at every stage of the revision process. 
                The very act of retrieving information and data from our brains not only strengthens our ability to retain information but also improves connections in our brains between different concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spaced repetition on the other hand takes advantage of the forgetting curve and involves spacing your revision and reviewing topics, at specific intervals over a period of time, ideally by active recall. 
                Because rereading has low utility, it is a passive exercise - just testing yourself once has been shown to be more effective than rereading the same passage four times -.

            <h1>So.. What is Memorize?</h1>
            <!-- <p>
                Memorize utilizes both active recall and spaced repetition through its Q&A and email notifications features.
            </p> -->
            <p>
                Memorize is a web learning tool that utilizes both active recall and spaced repitition to help you better retain information you learned. 
                Active recall includes features like Q&As, flash cards and quizzes. 
                As for spaced repetition, it is acheived with email notifications.
